# Airflow_Introduction

This is a memo to share what I have learnt in Apache Airflow.

The PPT presentation file `Airflow_Introduction.pdf` provides a simple introduction to Airflow, and some references to external resources. 

The DAG file `testJamesDAG.py` illustrates the DAG structure, and contains some common useful functions.

For a deeper learning about Airflow, please refer to another repository, where I have captured notes from a DataCamp course: https://github.com/JNYH/DataCamp_Introduction_to_Airflow
