# Airflow_Introduction

This is a memo to share what I have learnt in Apache Airflow.

The presentation file `Airflow_Introduction.pdf` provides a brief overview: 
* Airflow introduction
* Airflow key components
* Python code
* How to install Airflow

The DAG file `testJamesDAG.py` illustrates the DAG structure, and contains some common useful functions.

For a deeper learning about Airflow, please refer to another repository, where I have captured notes from a course in DataCamp: https://github.com/JNYH/DataCamp_Introduction_to_Airflow
