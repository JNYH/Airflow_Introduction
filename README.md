# Airflow_Introduction

This is a memo to share what I have learnt in Apache Airflow.

The PPT presentation file `Airflow_Introduction.pptx` provides a simple introduction to Airflow. For more details, refer to another repo: https://github.com/JNYH/DataCamp_Introduction_to_Airflow

The DAG file `testJamesDAG.py` contains some commonly used functions.
